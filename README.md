Introducing Desktop Pal, an AI-powered companion that seamlessly integrates into your desktop experience, bringing a new level of interaction to your digital workspace. Powered by native text-to-speech LLM models, Desktop Pal allows you to converse, engage, and get assistance—all while continuing your tasks without interruption.

Your default companion, Riku, is a friendly and intelligent female AI who’s not just here to help, but to connect with you. Whether you need support with your work, want to brainstorm ideas, or simply need someone to talk to, Desktop Pal is always there. With the ability to enter any initial prompt and use any GGUF model downloaded from Hugging Face, you can personalize your companion to suit your needs and make every interaction feel more natural.

More than just an assistant, Desktop Pal is a true companion—working alongside you, enhancing your workflow, and offering companionship in your daily tasks. Say goodbye to boring, impersonal tools, and welcome an AI that truly feels like part of your workspace.

It is highly recommended to install Cuda 12.2 even if you dont use it for improved load time and if Cuda is not detected it will still work but take longer to load the game up.

The model can be replaced in the packaged build of the game to any that you want to use, Just change the new model file name to what the current model file name is and it should work as long as its .gguf file format. Note: don't expect every GGUF model to work but i have tested many and a lot work and some do not.

100% offline, NO internet needed to run it, it is completely local only. The A.I's Feature TTS Voices and Speech recognition en-us, everything running 100% offline on your PC with privacy!

It is highly recommended to install Cuda 12.2 even if you dont use it for improved load time and if Cuda is not detected it will still work but take longer to load the game up.

The a.i model can be replaced in the packaged build of the game to any that you want to use, Just change the new model file name to what the current model file name is and it should work as long as its .gguf file format. Note: don't expect every GGUF model to work but i have tested many and a lot work and some do not.
